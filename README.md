# DCN Webtool

This repository includes all the relevant code to create the DCN Webtool.
It is designed with a Flask backend in mind, which you will have to set up by yourself.
We used:
```
Flask==2.0.3
Flask-Session==0.4.0
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.19.5
```
You can find the html code in the "template" folder, while the "Open" folder includes all python files used for the simulation and backend.
In the "static" folder are all the images and packages used by the html.
