# DCN Webtool

Visualizing multi-Qubit systems is challenging due to their high complexity. We present
the dimensional circle notation (DCN) as an extension of the so-called circle notation already in
use. This reduces the mathematical complexity while revealing entanglement properties of such
systems. DCN especially enhances understanding of entanglement and operations in multi-qubit
systems and can therefore be used in education and research alike.

---

This repository includes all the relevant code to create the DCN Webtool. With it you will be able to easily create visual representations of up to three Qubits.

To use the tool, just install all files in the requirements.txt. It is compatible with Python 3.10 and should also work on other Versions.

After installation is complete run views.py.
A local website will be created at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
